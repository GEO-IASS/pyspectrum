PySpectrum is a free and open source software created to process and analyze
hyperspectral data primarily obtained from Raman spectroscopy. These datasets
are multidimensional and extremely large in size, requiring computational tools
to look at areas of interest. PySpectrum provides the interface to interact with
the data and discover patterns in its many facets, as well as accelerate the
pace of its analysis.
